      Mathematics, the science of structure, order, and relation that has evolved from elemental
      practices of counting, measuring, and describing the shapes of objects. It deals with
      logical reasoning and quantitative calculation, and its development has involved an
      increasing degree of idealization and abstraction of its subject matter. Since the 17th
      century, mathematics has been an indispensable adjunct to the physical sciences and
      technology, and in more recent times it has assumed a similar role in the quantitative
      aspects of the life sciences.

    <p>
      In many cultures—under the stimulus of the needs of practical pursuits, such as
      commerce and agriculture—mathematics has developed far beyond basic counting. This
      growth has been greatest in societies complex enough to sustain these activities and
      to provide leisure for contemplation and the opportunity to build on the achievements
      of earlier mathematicians.
